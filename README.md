### Milestone 8: Product Card Component ðŸŒŸ

In Milestone 8, we created a reusable **product card component** to display product details like name, price, and image on the homepage. The card component is dynamic, accepting product information as props. We used **array mapping** to render a card for each product, ensuring the homepage remains clean and organized with a grid or flexbox layout.

### Whatâ€™s Completed:
- Designed a reusable **card component**.
- Created a responsive **homepage layout** to display multiple cards.
- Passed dynamic product data into the card using props and array mapping.

### Next Steps ðŸš€
In the next milestone, weâ€™ll add features like filtering and sorting. 

### Submission ðŸ“¥
- Push code to GitHub (public repo).
- Update README and share the repo link.### Milestone 8: Product Card Component ðŸŒŸ
