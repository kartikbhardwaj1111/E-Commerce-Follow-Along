## MILESTONE1 :-
1. Set Up the Development Environment
Installed all the necessary tools and dependencies to set up the development environment for the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project. This includes configuring the backend and frontend dependencies to ensure smooth development.
2. Understand Server-Client Interaction
Gained an understanding of how the frontend (React) interacts with the backend (Node.js/Express) using APIs. Focused on how the client sends requests to the server, and how the server processes them and sends back responses.
3. Set Up a Simple Server
Created a basic server using Node.js and Express, laying the foundation for the project. The server is set up to handle API requests and provide a foundation for future endpoints and business logic.

---
## MILESTONE 2  :-
1. Create a Structured Folder Hierarchy
Designed and implemented a structured folder hierarchy for the project, organizing the files in a way that ensures easy maintainability and scalability for both the frontend and backend.
2. Set Up React App (Frontend) and Node.js Server (Backend)
Frontend: Set up a React app to serve as the user interface for the project.
Backend: Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests, providing the foundation for server-side logic and database interaction.
3. Configure Tailwind CSS for Styling
Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS into the project to streamline the styling process and improve the overall design flexibility with utility-first CSS.
4. Add Optional Extensions for Development Efficiency
Installed and configured optional extensions such as Prettier, ESLint, and others to improve code formatting, quality, and overall development workflow.

## MILESTONE3 :- 
1. Set Up Dedicated Folders for Organizing Backend Code
Created dedicated folders for organizing the backend code. This ensures better structure and maintainability of the server-side code, with clear separation of concerns.
2. Initialized and Configured a Node.js Server
Set up a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests. This provides the backbone for the backend, allowing it to process incoming requests and return responses.
3. Connected the Application to MongoDB
Established a connection to MongoDB, enabling the application to store and manage data in a NoSQL database. This allows for flexible data handling and seamless interactions with the backend.
4. Implemented Basic Error Handling

## Milestone 6: User Registration and Authentication
1. User Creation Endpoint (/create-user):
 - Implemented an endpoint to create a new user.
 - Validated the email to ensure the user doesn’t already exist.
 - Successfully handled file uploads (e.g., avatar) using multer.

 2. Password Hashing:
 Used bcryptjs to hash passwords before saving them to the database, ensuring secure password storage.

4. Error Handling:
- Incorporated centralized error handling using a custom ErrorHandler class.
- Applied catchAsyncErrors middleware to manage asynchronous errors in the routes.

5. User Data Storage:
Stored user details (e.g., name, email, password, avatar) in MongoDB with encrypted password.

6. Email Notification (Optional):
Integrated an email notification system to send a welcome email to the user after successful registration (using sendMail).

7. JWT Token Generation:
Added a method to generate JWT tokens upon user login (for future use in authentication routes).

---

## Milestone 7 : 

1. Created a Login Endpoint

- Accepts user credentials (email/username and password).

- Retrieves the corresponding user from the database.

- Returns an error message if the user does not exist.

2. Implemented Password Validation

- Used bcrypt to hash the entered password.

- Compared it with the stored hashed password for authentication.

- If the passwords match, authentication is successful; otherwise, an error is returned.

    - Product Image

    - Product Name

    - Price

    - Description

    - Add to Cart Button

- Used props to pass dynamic product data.

2. Implemented the Homepage Layout  

- Created a HomePage component to display multiple product cards.

- Used array mapping to iterate over a product list and render cards dynamically.

- Ensured a clean and structured layout for better UI/UX.

3. Updated Routes in App.jsx

- Integrated HomePage into the routing system.

- Ensured seamless navigation across the application.

## Milestone : 9

Today, we will create a frontend form for taking products input. Let’s dive in and understand what this all means!

Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Learn how to create a form that will take all the details of product
Learn how to take multiple images as input.
Why Create Product form?
Here we will create an form to input all the details of product.
This details will be eventually saved in database and will be displayed on products home page we created in previous milestone.
Steps for Milestone 9📝
Create the form for products

This form will take multiple product images images as input

Note:- This lesson will help you in understanding the basic creating of products please feel free to experiment on adding more features like creating an admin access and allow only admin to upload products or create and shop profile and a user with only shop profile can upload.

## Milestone 10:

**Creating the Product Schema and API Endpoint**
In this milestone, we focused on defining the structure of product data and creating an API endpoint to store product details in MongoDB.
1. Product Schema Definition:
- Defined a structured product schema using Mongoose to store product data in MongoDB.
- Ensured each field has proper validation to maintain data integrity:
- Name: Required, string**
- Description: Required, string
- Price: Required, number, with validation for non-negative values
- Image URL(s): Required, array of strings for multiple image storage
- Category: Required, string
- CreatedAt: Automatically generated timestamp

2. Endpoint Creation:
- Developed a POST endpoint (/api/products) to accept product details from the frontend.
- Implemented validation to ensure only correctly formatted data is stored in the database.
- Saved product information to MongoDB using Mongoose models.
3. Data Validation & Integrity:
- Enforced strict validation to prevent invalid or incomplete product entries.
- Returned appropriate error messages for missing or incorrect data inputs.
4. Future Enhancements & Experimentation:
- Considered adding role-based access control:
- Admin Access: Only admin users can create new products.
- Shop Profiles: Restrict product uploads to users with a registered shop profile.
- Image Upload Handling: Implement a cloud-based solution (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3) for better image management. make this short

## Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:

- Learn how to write an endpoint to filter and send data from MongoDB based on a user's email.
- Understand how to fetch and receive data on the frontend.
- Display data dynamically using a product card component.

## Steps to Complete Milestone 12 📝

### Backend:
1. **Create an endpoint** in your backend application that retrieves all products associated with a user's email from MongoDB.
2. **Filter products** based on the email provided in the request.
3. **Send the filtered data** as a response to the frontend.

### Frontend:
1. **Write a function** to fetch the filtered product data from the backend.
2. **Process the received data** and pass it to the product card component.
3. **Dynamically display** the products on the "My Products" page.

## Notes
- This lesson will help in understanding how to filter data based on specific constraints and send it to the client efficiently.
- Ensure proper error handling for scenarios where no products are found for a given email.

## Next Steps
